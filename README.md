##Capstone Project: Vietnam Culinary tourism (Part 1)
###Introduction:
Every year, many foreign tourists travel to Vietnam. According to the General Statistics Office, the estimated number of international visitors to Vietnam in December 2019 reached more than 1.7 million, for the whole year of 2019 more than 18 million. The total revenue from tourists reached 726 million VND, higher 17.1% than the same period in 2018. This is the evidence that Vietnam attracts lots of foreigner in the world. They come to Vietnam because of not only visit locations but also Vietnamese cuisine.
Imagine that you are managing a travel agency outside Vietname and have to prepare a plan for a group of tourists. They are considering between Ho Chi Minh city and Ha Noi capital, and they want to prioritize culinary discovery. The problem we aim to solve is to analyze whether Ho Chi Minh city or Ha Noi capital has more places to eat and more convinient for tourists to move between these places.
###Data section:
We will use the Foursquare API to get data which include locations of places to eat in two big city in Vietnam: Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh.
